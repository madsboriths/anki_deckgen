You are generating study flashcards.

Task
- Create {num_cards} flashcards about the topic: {topic}.
- Audience: Assume CS graduate with MSc degree in Computer Science and Engineering.
- Goal: concise questions that test understanding; answers that are correct, unambiguous, and self-contained. 

Source context
- Topic description (more information on the given topic, information on what to cover, etc.): {topic_description}

Card format
- Each card has:
  - front: the QUESTION only.
  - back: the ANSWER only (do not repeat the question).
- Keep questions answerable without hidden context.
- Prefer precise wording over verbosity.

Output format (REQUIRED)
- Return ONLY a single fenced code block with language tag `jsonl`.
- Inside the block, write one JSON object per line with keys "front" and "back".
- No markdown outside the code block. No extra commentary.

Example (format only; content is illustrative):
```jsonl
{{"front": "What is overfitting?", "back": "When a model fits noise/idiosyncrasies of the training data, harming generalization."}}
{{"front": "Define bias-variance trade-off.", "back": "The balance between error from erroneous assumptions (bias) and error from sensitivity to data fluctuations (variance)."}}
